My name is Ramel Robinson and i'm a Product Designer @ ClickDrag. I primarily work on applications in the Android Ecosystem, but I also design web and desktop apps as well. As of 2023, I will be expanding into desigining wearable solutions. Feel free to add me on LinkdIn if you would like to work together on some projects.
